Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number
of coins needed to meet a given amount total.

 - Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet total
           If total is 0 or less, return 0
           If total cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return -1

coins is a list of the values of the coins in your possession
The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0
assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list
solutionâ€™s runtime will be evaluated
