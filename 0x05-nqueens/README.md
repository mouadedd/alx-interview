0x05. N Queens

The “0x05. N queens” project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. To successfully complete this project, you will need to understand several key concepts and have access to resources that will help you grasp the necessary algorithms and techniques.

Concepts Needed:

[Backtracking Algorithms:](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-backtracking-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/)

Understanding how backtracking algorithms work to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.

[Recursion:](https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/)

Using recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms.

Recursion in Python

[List Manipulations in Python:](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

Creating and manipulating lists, especially to store the positions of queens on the board.

[Python Command Line Arguments:](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/sys.html#sys.argv)

Handling command-line arguments with the sys module.
